Feature: Manage a booking through its lifecycle

  Background:
    Given the booking service is available
    And I have a valid admin token

  Scenario: Create, retrieve, update, patch and delete a booking
    When I create a unique booking
    Then the booking should be created
    And the booking should be retrievable
    And the booking response should match the booking JSON schema
    When I replace the booking details
    Then the replaced details should be persisted
    When I partially update the price and additional needs
    Then only the selected booking fields should change
    When I delete the booking
    Then retrieving the deleted booking should return 404

  @negative
  Scenario: An unauthenticated update is rejected
    Given I created a unique booking
    When I try to replace it without authentication
    Then the update response should be 401 or 403
